Metal Archives Scraper
======================

A utility for extracting band-related data from [Encyclopaedia Metallum](http://www.metal-archives.com/), programmed in ECMAScript.

**Nota bene:** This requires an account with moderator-level access. If you're not a member of the site's staff, this repo will be useless to you. Seriously.


Installation
------------

You'll need a bleeding-edge version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/) to run this.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alhadis/MA-Scraper.git && cd MA-Scraper
npm install
echo '{"username":"USERNAME_HERE", "password":"PASSWORD_HERE"}' > .devrc.json
```
